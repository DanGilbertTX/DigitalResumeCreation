# Creating a Digital Resume

You will need several things to create a digital resume. In no particular order, you will need:

* Somewhere to host it. AWS or your own server are probably best. I went with a $6/mo. OVH VPS instance because I like headless Linux and know how to lock it down.
* A good template; I used iPortfolio from BootstrapMade: https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/
* A text editor; I use Notepad++
* A background image you want to use; should be 1920x1080 for proper scaling
* Some personal pictures and your resume
* Time and patience



The end result will be something like this site (but hopefully much, MUCH better): https://burninggnome.net/

#####To start, download whatever template you want to your local computer and unzip it. Assuming you are using iPortfolio from the link above, the following files/directories are the ones you will be working with:

  * ./index.html
  * ./assets/img/
  * ./assets/css/style.css
  * ./forms/contact.php *`If you buy the template and want to use the contact form`*


Once you have the template unzip, go ahead and open ./index.html in both a web browers (so you can see changes) and in your text editor. Alternatively, you can steal my index.html page if you want. Just view source/view page source on that site and it will open up the index.html in the browser. Copy/paste it in to your text editor and start making changes there.

#####Other than content changes, here are specific items you will need to change:

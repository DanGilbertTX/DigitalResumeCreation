# Creating a Digital Resume

You will need several things to create a digital resume. In no particular order, you will need:

* Somewhere to host it. AWS or your own server are probably best. I went with a $6/mo. OVH VPS instance because I like headless Linux and know how to lock it down.
* A good template; I used iPortfolio from BootstrapMade: https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/
* A text editor; I use Notepad++
* A background image you want to use; should be 1920x1080 for proper scaling
* Some personal pictures and your resume
* Time and patience
